Afterword

After finishing this stage, you are totally free to improve the project in any way you like to make it a more convenient and useful tool.

You can add any features to your application. It will not be verified by tests, so there are no strict requirements.

Sample ideas:

1.    Add a complex exam. Increase a difficulty level on the fly. For example, if a person passed the 1st level, start the 2nd one immediately.
2.    You can add a correction level: store the tasks with wrong answers and give them next time.
3.    Add more difficulty levels.
4.    Track the time (read about Timer).
5.    Write a more detailed report to a file with the results.
6.    Show previous results inside the app (show lines from results.txt that contains the username)
7.    Any other improvement that might be useful!
